# Main Thread APIs

<APISummary />

Main Thread Script allows JavaScript scripts to be executed on the main thread.

Main Thread Scripts are commonly used for smooth animations and gesture handling. They address the response delay issue caused by events being triggered and handled on different threads in the Lynx multi-threaded architecture, thereby achieving a near-native interactive experience.

## Compatibility
