# Managing Spec

The Lynx Living Specification serves as the definitive technical reference for the Lynx engine.

## Location

The spec source files are located in `packages/lynx-living-spec/`.
The source `.bs` files are specifically in `packages/lynx-living-spec/src/`.

## Format

The spec is written in **Bikeshed** (`.bs`), a preprocessor for specification documents often used by W3C standards.

## Prerequisites

To build the spec, you need to have **Bikeshed** installed. We recommend using `pipx` to install it.

### Install pipx

If you don't have `pipx` installed, you can install it via Homebrew (on macOS):

```bash
brew install pipx
```

### Install Bikeshed

Once `pipx` is installed, install `bikeshed`:

```bash
pipx install bikeshed
```

## Editing the Spec

1. Modify the `.bs` files in `packages/lynx-living-spec/src/`.
   - `index.bs` is the main entry point.
   - Other sections are split into separate files like `styling.bs`, `scripting.bs`, etc.
2. To build the spec locally, run:

```bash
pnpm gen:living-spec
```

This uses a script (`scripts/lynx-living-spec.js`) to invoke `bikeshed` and generate the HTML output at `docs/public/living-spec/index.html`.
