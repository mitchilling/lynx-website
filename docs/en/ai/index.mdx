# Lynx for AI

LLMs are trained on public web data, which means they often lack awareness of the latest Lynx features and best practices. The Lynx team and community are developing a suite of tools to help LLMs understand and develop Lynx more effectively.

## Teaching LLMs about Lynx

### Using Lynx Docs MCP

[Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/getting-started/intro) is a standard for connecting LLMs to external tools. Lynx Docs MCP allows the agent fetch accurate guides, API references directly from the Lynx documentation site, to ensure its answers stay correct and up to date.

Read more about Lynx Docs MCP in [Lynx Docs MCP](lynx-docs-mcp.mdx).

### Using `llms.txt`

[llms.txt](https://llmstxt.org/) is a standard to help LLMs use a website as a knowledge base. The Lynx website fully supports it, so you can either copy the Markdown or provide its URL to any LLM with web-browsing. For every page, you can get the original Markdown by replacing the `.html` extension with `.md`. For example:

- [https://lynxjs.org/llms.txt](https://lynxjs.org/llms.txt)
- [https://lynxjs.org/react/introduction.md](https://lynxjs.org/react/introduction.md)

## Developing with Agents

### Using `AGENTS.md`

The [`AGENTS.md`](https://agents.md) file is similar to `README.md`, but it's for agents. Learn how to add a suitable `AGENTS.md` for your Lynx project in [AGENTS.md for Lynx](agentsmd.mdx).

### Lynx DevTool MCP

[Lynx DevTool MCP](lynx-devtool-mcp.mdx) is the Lynx DevTool for coding agents.
It lets coding agents _**control, operate and preview**_ Lynx pages, just like human does in DevTool.
